</a><h1>What is Gentrification </h1>

    
    
   <h2>Gentrification is a process in which wealthier individuals move into a low-income urban area, resulting in the renovation, revitalization, and redevelopment of the area. The community will typically have rising property values, increased rent prices, and changes in the cultural and demographic makeup of the neighborhood. Often displacing long-time residents and local businesses from the area. </h2>

     <center> <h2> Join or support local community organizations and movements that are working to address gentrification and advocate for the rights of long-time residents. Participate in community meetings, events, and protests to voice concerns and collaborate on solutions. Support tenets that promote an end to gentrification.

        <h1>About Lower East Side, New York
            Gentrification   </h1>
        
        <h2>Gentrification in New York City has been driven by factors such as increasing demand for housing in locations, and improvements in infrastructure and public safety. While gentrification has brought investment, development, and economic growth to these areas, it has also resulted in rising housing costs, displacement of long-time residents, and changes in neighborhood character and demographics. This has led to debates and discussions about issues of affordability, social equity, and community identity in the city. This will have a negative impact of taking away homes to the community that have lower income. </h2>
